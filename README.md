### Notes
Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
A only problem I face building this app was a strange error that stated:
error: Thread 1: "-[UITableViewCellContentView setText:]: unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x12ac11c60"
After carefully looking over my work I was able to detect that there was a problem in the way I connected my labels, and my UIViewImage Icon. After I figured that the rest of the project went very smoothly!
